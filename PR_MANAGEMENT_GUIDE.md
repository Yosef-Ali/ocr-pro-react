### LOW PRIORITY - Documentation (Merge Last)

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixes (Do First)
1. **Review PR #6** - Test the fix for result cleanup
   ```bash
   git checkout codex/remove-promise.all-in-removefile
   npm run test
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Review PR #3** - Check if it conflicts with PR #6
   - If they conflict: merge PR #6 first, then resolve conflicts in PR #3
   - If no conflicts: can merge both in sequence

### Phase 2: Code Quality (Do Second)  
3. **Review PR #2** - ESLint configuration
   ```bash
   git checkout copilot/fix-1bab4a07-f3df-4613-8fee-d8b004d3992f
   npm run lint    # Should pass with 0 errors
   npm run build   # Should complete successfully
   npm run test    # Should pass all tests
   ```

### Phase 3: Documentation (Do Last)
4. **Quick merge PR #5 and PR #4** - Documentation updates
   - These are low risk, quick to review
   - Can be batch processed

5. **Complete and merge PR #7** - This guide

## Merge Strategy

### For Bug Fixes (PR #3, #6)
- Require passing tests
- Manual testing of affected functionality  
- Squash merge to keep history clean

### For Code Quality (PR #2)
- Require full lint/build/test pass
- Review all changed files carefully
- Regular merge to preserve commit history

### For Documentation (PR #4, #5)
- Quick review for accuracy
- Squash merge

## Preventing Future PR Buildup

### 1. Implement PR Template
Create `.github/pull_request_template.md`:
```markdown
## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature  
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Code quality improvement

## Checklist
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Lint passes locally
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Manual testing completed (if applicable)
```

### 2. Automated Quality Gates
Consider adding GitHub Actions for:
- Automatic linting on PR
- Test execution on PR
- Build verification

### 3. Regular PR Review Schedule
- Review PRs weekly maximum
- Prioritize: bugs → features → docs
- Close stale/outdated PRs

## Command Quick Reference

```bash
# Check out specific PR branch
git fetch origin
git checkout <branch-name>

# Test PR locally
npm run lint
npm run build  
npm run test

# Merge PR (after GitHub review)
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff <branch-name>
git push origin main

# Clean up merged branch
git branch -d <branch-name>
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```

## Conflict Resolution

If PRs conflict:
1. Merge higher priority PR first
2. Rebase lower priority PR:
   ```bash
   git checkout <conflicting-branch>
   git rebase main
   # Resolve conflicts
   git add .
   git rebase --continue
   git push --force-with-lease origin <conflicting-branch>
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Review and merge PR #6 (critical bug fix)
2. **This week**: Handle PR #3 and PR #2 
3. **Quick wins**: Merge documentation PRs #4 and #5
4. **Process**: Implement PR template and review schedule

Remember: It's better to merge working code incrementally than to let PRs accumulate and become stale.
