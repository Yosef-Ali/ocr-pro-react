# Immediate Action Plan for Multiple PRs

## ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT: Do This Today

### 1. Install Dependencies First
```bash
# Your main branch needs dependencies installed
npm install
```

### 2. Critical Bug Fix - PR #6 (Highest Priority)
```bash
# Validate the critical bug fix after installing dependencies
./scripts/validate-pr.sh codex/remove-promise.all-in-removefile

# If validation passes:
# 1. Go to GitHub and review PR #6
# 2. Test the fix manually if possible
# 3. Merge immediately - this is a critical bug fix
```

### 3. IMPORTANT: Review PR #2 First (ESLint Setup)
```bash
# This PR adds essential linting and fixes code quality issues
# Your current main branch has build/lint issues that PR #2 fixes
# Consider prioritizing this PR to fix the development environment
./scripts/validate-pr.sh copilot/fix-1bab4a07-f3df-4613-8fee-d8b004d3992f
```

### 4. Review Potential Conflict - PR #3
```bash
# Check if PR #3 conflicts with PR #6
./scripts/validate-pr.sh codex/add-tests-for-removefile-functionality

# This PR also fixes removeFile functionality - may conflict with PR #6
# If conflicts: merge PR #6 first, then resolve conflicts in PR #3
```

## üìã This Week's Schedule

### Monday (Today)
- [ ] Merge PR #6 (critical bug fix)
- [ ] Check PR #3 for conflicts after merging PR #6

### Tuesday 
- [ ] Resolve PR #3 (either merge or fix conflicts)
- [ ] Review PR #2 (ESLint fixes - large impact)

### Wednesday
- [ ] Test PR #2 thoroughly (affects entire codebase)
- [ ] Merge PR #2 if all tests pass

### Thursday-Friday
- [ ] Quick merge PR #5 (docs: analysis wording)
- [ ] Quick merge PR #4 (docs: performance optimization)
- [ ] Complete and merge PR #7 (this management guide)

## üö® Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK - Handle Carefully:**
- PR #2: ESLint config affects entire codebase
- PR #3 & #6: Both modify removeFile functionality (potential conflicts)

**LOW RISK - Quick Wins:**
- PR #4 & #5: Documentation only
- PR #7: Adding management documentation

## üîß Quick Commands

```bash
# Validate any PR before merging
./scripts/validate-pr.sh <branch-name>

# List all open PR branches
git branch -r | grep -v 'main\|HEAD'

# Check current branch status
git status

# See all recent commits across branches
git log --oneline --graph --all -10
```

## üìû Emergency Contacts

If something goes wrong:
1. Don't panic - all branches are preserved
2. Check the backup branch created by validation script
3. Return to main branch: `git checkout main`
4. Restore from backup if needed: `git checkout backup-<timestamp>`

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

By end of week you should have:
- [ ] Zero critical bugs (PR #6 merged)
- [ ] Clean codebase (PR #2 merged)
- [ ] Updated documentation (PR #4, #5 merged)
- [ ] 3 or fewer open PRs remaining
- [ ] Clear process for future PRs

**Remember: Better to merge working code incrementally than let PRs go stale!**
