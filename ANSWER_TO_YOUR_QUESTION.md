## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do Today)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
Your main branch is missing installed dependencies:
```bash
cd /path/to/ocr-pro-react
npm install
```

### Step 2: Priority Order for Merging PRs
**Merge in this exact order:**

1. **PR #2** - "Add ESLint configuration and fix code quality issues" ⭐ **MOST IMPORTANT**
   - **Why first:** Fixes your broken build/lint system
   - **Action:** Review thoroughly, this affects entire codebase
   - **Risk:** High (but necessary)

2. **PR #6** - "fix: guard result cleanup when removing files" 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG**
   - **Why second:** Critical bug fix
   - **Action:** Test and merge immediately after PR #2
   - **Risk:** Low

3. **PR #3** - "fix: sync removeFile state updates with result cleanup" 🐛 **RELATED BUG**
   - **Why third:** May conflict with PR #6, handle after
   - **Action:** Check for conflicts with PR #6, resolve if needed
   - **Risk:** Medium (potential conflicts)

4. **PR #5** - "docs: clarify document analysis wording" 📝 **LOW PRIORITY**
   - **Why fourth:** Documentation only, safe to merge
   - **Action:** Quick review and merge
   - **Risk:** Very low

5. **PR #4** - "Update performance optimizations documentation" 📝 **LOW PRIORITY**
   - **Why fifth:** Documentation only, safe to merge  
   - **Action:** Quick review and merge
   - **Risk:** Very low

6. **PR #7** - This management guide (current PR)
   - **Why last:** Adds process documentation
   - **Action:** Complete and merge after others
   - **Risk:** None

## ⚡ Quick Decision Framework

**For each PR, ask:**
1. Does it fix a critical bug? → Merge ASAP
2. Does it affect the entire codebase? → Review carefully
3. Is it just documentation? → Quick merge
4. Does it conflict with other PRs? → Handle conflicts first

## 🚨 Warning Signs in Your Repository

Your main branch currently has:
- ❌ Build failures (TypeScript config issues)
- ❌ Missing ESLint setup 
- ❌ Test framework not working

**This is why PR #2 is so important - it fixes your development environment.**

## 📅 Suggested Timeline

**Today (Monday):**
- [ ] Install dependencies: `npm install`
- [ ] Review and merge PR #2 (ESLint fixes)
- [ ] Test that build/lint now works

**Tuesday:**
- [ ] Merge PR #6 (critical bug fix)
- [ ] Check PR #3 for conflicts

**Wednesday:**  
- [ ] Resolve PR #3
- [ ] Quick merge PR #5 and PR #4 (docs)

**Thursday:**
- [ ] Complete PR #7 (this guide)
- [ ] Clean up any remaining issues

## 🎯 Success Metrics

By end of week:
- ✅ Working build system (no TypeScript errors)
- ✅ Working linting (`npm run lint` passes)
- ✅ Working tests (`npm run test` passes) 
- ✅ 0-1 open PRs remaining
- ✅ Clear process for future PRs

## 🛠️ Tools Created for You

I've created these tools to help:
- `PR_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete management strategy
- `IMMEDIATE_ACTION_PLAN.md` - Detailed weekly schedule
- `scripts/validate-pr.sh` - Automated PR validation
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` - Template for future PRs

## 🤔 Why This Happened

Multiple PRs accumulated because:
1. No clear merge priority system
2. Missing quality gates (broken build/lint)
3. No regular review schedule
4. Related PRs created conflicts

The tools above prevent this in the future.

## ✅ Bottom Line

**Your main action: Merge PR #2 first (ESLint setup), then tackle bugs, then docs.**

PR #2 is the foundation that makes everything else work properly. Without it, your development environment stays broken.
